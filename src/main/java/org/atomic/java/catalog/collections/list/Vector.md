Vector

**定义：**

	自动增长的对象数组，跟ArrayList差不多

**特点：**

	Vector是**线程安全的**

	操作都带有 synchronized 关键字，所以是线程安全的



原码中的属性：（java8）

```
/**
     * The array buffer into which the components of the vector are
     * stored. The capacity of the vector is the length of this array buffer,
     * and is at least large enough to contain all the vector's elements.
     *
     * <p>Any array elements following the last element in the Vector are null.
     *
     * @serial

    protected Object[] elementData;

    /**

     * Components {@code elementData[0]} through
     * {@code elementData[elementCount-1]} are the actual items.
     *
     * @serial
     */
    protected int elementCount;

    /**
     * The amount by which the capacity of the vector is automatically
     * incremented when its size becomes greater than its capacity.  If
     * the capacity increment is less than or equal to zero, the capacity
     * of the vector is doubled each time it needs to grow.
     *
     * @serial

    protected int capacityIncrement;

    /** use serialVersionUID from JDK 1.0.2 for interoperability */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -2767605614048989439L;
```



初始化构造是10

```
public Vector() {
    this(10);
}
```
